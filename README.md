# Cpusplus-Program
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was an example of working for a customer who owned and operated a grocery store. This customer, know as Corner Grocer, wanted a program that could track items that were sold on a given day. Corner Grocer required this program so that they could create a layout of the store that would maximize profit. Corner Grocer would supply a text file with the names of the items sold as they were sold in chronological order. Their requirements were to have a list of all the items sold with the number of times they were sold during the day, the ability to search for an item to see how many times it was sold, and to produce a histogram representation of the items sold. 

# What did you do particularly well?
During this project, I was able to incorporate everything that I have learned so far during the C++ course. I was able to incorporate functions through Python that handle the data analysis. Creating lists that handled the data and stored the information to be passed either to the user or to another function to be further processed. Also, I was able to read text files to store the information into lists and then write to text files to build a frequency file. Through the use of If statements and Switch Cases I was able to handle data validation from a user. Finally, I used Python and C++ concurrently to complete the program and deliver it to the customer. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One way that I could improve my code is by finding a way to secure the program that I built. Since I have not had much experience with building secure projects, I did not build the project securely. One way that there might be a vulnerability is in the form of the files. Someone that should not have access to the files would be able to easily access them through the file system. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Something that was challenging to write was the requirement to search for an item and display how many times that item was sold during the day. The reason that it was challenging was that I was using multiple lists to store the names and quantities of the items. This meant that I had to remember to incorporate both lists when printing the information. Another piece was that I had to ensure that when the code found the item that it was searching for that it stopped and printed the item with the number of times that it was sold. In my first build of the function, the program would continue to search through the list and report that the item did not sell even if it did. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A skill that will be transferable to other projects is the ability to incorporate multiple languages into a single project. Since all languages have strengths and weaknesses it is important to be able to build projects using the best of multiple languages. This ensures that the project is built with quality in mind.


# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program with maintainability, readability, and adaptability in mind by building functions. I built the program with functions so that if something needed to be updated one would only need to find the function that handles the requirement. I also added comments explaining the processes involved with the functions and the program as a whole so that others would be able to go in and understand the work that is being done.
